Instructions to make this project.
1. Try to develop this project in some clound enviroment for smooth execution in less time because the dataset and google pretrained - model used is of very big in size nearly(600MB and 1.6GB) making execution tough for your local machine. {You can use google colab for this}
   
2. To load the dataset run the following,
