# Machine-Learning-Projects---Begineer

This repository is based on a challenge that I given to myself when I start my machine learning journey
"30 Days 30 Machine learning projects".

In this Challenge I had created 30 beginner friendly ML projects which will enhance skills including data-preprocessing, model creation , performance validation and hyper-paprameter tunning. 

I had used datasets from kaggle and preforms the Machine Learning task(regression, classification & clustring) as per the problem statements. 

List of Projects:-
1. Rocks & Mines prediction using Sonar Dataset.
2. Diabetes predication.
