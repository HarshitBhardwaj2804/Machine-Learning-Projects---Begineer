# Machine-Learning-Projects---Begineer

This repository is based on a challenge that I given to myself when I start my machine learning journey
"30 Days 30 Machine learning projects".

In this Challenge I had created 30 beginner friendly ML projects which will enhance skills including data-preprocessing, model creation , performance validation and hyper-parameter tunning. 

I had used datasets from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and preforms the Machine Learning task(regression, classification & clustring) as per the given problem statements.
