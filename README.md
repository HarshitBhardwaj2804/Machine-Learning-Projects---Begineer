# Machine-Learning-Projects---Begineer

This repository is based on a challenge that I given to myself when I start my machine learning journey
"30 Days 30 Machine learning projects".

In this Challenge I had created 30 beginner friendly ML projects which will enhance skills including data-preprocessing, model creation , performance validation and hyper-parameter tunning. 

I had used datasets from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and preforms the Machine Learning task(regression, classification & clustring) as per the given problem statements. 

List of Projects:-
1. Rocks & Mines prediction using Sonar Dataset.
2. Diabetes predication.
3. Loan Default Prediction.
4. California House Price Prediction.
5. Flight Price Prediction.
6. Extrovert vs. Introvert Behavior Data Prediction.
7. Brain stroke prediction.
8. Used car price predication.
9. Medical insurance cost prediction.
10. Concrete strength prediction.
11. Android malware detection preject.
12. Wine quality prediction.
13.
